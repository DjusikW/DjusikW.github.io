                Upwell Structures are large player-made structures. They provide services and docking facilities which
                in many ways mirror those provided by NPC stations, but they differ somewhat in their mechanics. In some
                they are more useful than NPC stations, but on the other hand they can be destroyed.
                In high- and low-security space, Upwell structures are useful tools for corporations; in null-security
                space and even more so in wormholes, they can be essential bases and semi-permanent homes for players.

            <p>
                Much like anything else, Upwell structures are manufactured out of sub-components. Structure components
                can be either bought from the market, built in stations or in Component Assembly Arrays. The final
                assembly of the structures can take place in either a station or Equipment Assembly Array. Structure
                components are distinguished by their usage of a good bit of Planetary Industry materials in their
                construction.

            <h3 class='Upwell_h'>Citadels</h3>
            <p>Citadels are Upwell Structures meant to be used as operation bases. They receive bonuses to combat rig
                effectiveness, market service fuel usage and cloning bay fuel usage. Citadels also have the shortest
                vulnerability durations and strongest combat options making them easier to defend.
            </p>
            <p>The three
                citadels are Astrahus (medium), Fortizar (large) and Keepstar (extra large). They have exactly
                same structure bonuses so the difference is only how many things they can have fitted and how much of a
                status symbol they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a special Upwell Palatine Keepstar extra-large citadel. This citadel has ridiculously high
                material requirements, estimated at around 100 Trillion ISK and only one can be deployed at any given
                time. As of 2022 no one has anchored a Palatine Keepstar, however the primary structure on the
                Singularity test server in M-OEE8 -- the combat testing system -- is a Palatine owned by CCP.

                    The advanced Faction upgraded Fortizars are special edition structures released in limited numbers
                    to capsuleers by the Upwell Consortium as part of their outpost migration project of YC120. During
                    the outpost migration event all Outposts and Conquerable stations were converted into these new
                    faction Fortizars, and after that event no more copies of these structures or their blueprints have
                    been made available to capsuleers. Faction Fortizars still existing in their original spot and never
                    unanchored or destroyed have special unique rigs with enhanced bonuses.
                    There are 5 types of Faction Fortizars, one for each of the four former outpost types (Null-Sec
                    stations deployed by player alliances), and one for the Immensea conquerable stations.

                Founded on the tenets of patriotism and hard work that carried its ancestors through hardships on an
                inhospitable homeworld, the Caldari State is today a corporate dictatorship, led by rulers who are
                determined to see it return to the meritocratic ideals of old. Ruthless and efficient in the boardroom
                as well as on the battlefield, the Caldari are living emblems of strength, persistence, and dignity.

            <h2 class='Caldari_h'>History</h2>
            <p class='history'>
                The home planet of the Caldari is Caldari Prime in the system of Gallente. The Gallente
                prime, the home planet of the Gallente, is located in the same system.
                The Caldari were once part of the Gallente Federation. Soon after the technology for interstellar travel
                was rediscovered in Gallente Federation the Caldari corporations started secret colonization of their
                own. Once the Gallente Federation found out about these colonies the Federation of course demanded that
                they are put under the authority of the Federation. The Caldari corporations declined. The relationships
                were tense and Caldari Prime was put under blockade. Eventually, Caldari partisans in Caldari Prime
                sabotaged an underwater Gallente city. The Gallente retaliated with orbital bombardment and the Gallente
                - Caldari war began. The war lasted for a hundred years until the newly formed CONCORD was finally able
                to negotiate peace between the two factions. Caldari Prime is still under Gallente control to this day
                and the relationships between Gallente and Caldari are very bad. Before the founding of the state, the
                Caldari were not a singular entity.
                Like their Gallente neighbors, they were composed of different races on different continents across
                Caldari Prime, although the bulk of the population was located on the Tikiona continent.
                Tikiona was united between AD 17453 and AD 20988 under the Raata Empire, with existing ethnicities at
                the time organized into political entities in the form of houses.

            <h2 class='Caldari_h'>Megacorporations</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Caldari State is made up of eight great megacorporations which are the CBD Corporation, Hyasyoda
                Corporation, Ishukone Corporation, Kaalakiota Corporation, Lai Dai Corporation, Nugoeihuvi Corporation,
                Sukuuvestaa Corporation, and Wiyrkomi Corporation. Together they own more than 90% of all property
                within the State. Each of the corporations is made up of thousands of companies of various sizes and
                various sorts, ranging from mining companies to police companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there is no single unified government, each corporation rules their territory, like their own
                kingdom, with little interference from the other corporations. Competition, efficiency, and market share
                are more important to the corporations than the accumulation of wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each corporation is made up of thousands of smaller companies, ranging from industrial companies to law
                firms. All land and real estate are owned by a company that leases it to the citizens. They control and
                rule every aspect of society and government. Each megacorporation handles its own policing. Although
                this gives the corporations dictatorial powers, they are just as bound by Caldari customs and laws as
                the individual, and the fierce, continual competition between the corporations ensures a healthy,
                consumer-based social environment, which benefits everyone. As a result business for the good of the
                individual rather than the good of the many is something totally alien to the Caldari.

            <h3>Full Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Full IntroductionWhile the "Into the Abyss" expansion adds a number of other changes, this new
                Triglavian faction is the primary focus of this page, with the related Abyssal Deadspace complexes
                on
                top.
                The core source of most of the Triglavian content is the Abyssal Deadspace complexes, which are
                unique
                complexes in a separate and isolated area of space for which only one person can participate in at a
                time. These sites are the source for the BPCs used to build Triglavian ships, also called Precursor
                vessels; these sites also provide "keys" to access other complexes, blueprints for Entropic
                Disintegrator modules, Abyssal Deadspace modifier items and some apparel items.
                Precursor vessels are the only ships that can use the Entropic Disintegrator modules which have a
                different setup than the conventional weapon systems most EVE players are familiar with. They focus
                on
                an armor tank with emphasis on utility; much like the Society of Conscious Thought vessels, these
                hulls
                tend to be somewhat mediocre but can excel in very specific situations. They are specifically
                equipped
                to use the Entropic Disintegrator weapon system: all of the hulls have only one turret slot yet have
                two
                or more utility high slots, possibly to synergize with the remote armor repair bonuses on each hull.
                Entropic Disintegrators are a curious weapon system which has some parallels to laser systems, with
                an
                interesting but rather specific attribute whereby the damage modifier of the weapon system increases
                with each shot fired.
                Abyssal Mutaplasmids are special modifier elements which are designed to modify certain attributes
                of
                select modules. An example would be a Microwarpdrive: the mutaplasmid can boost or decrease the
                velocity
                bonus, the powergrid requirement, the signature radius modifier or the activation cost. This allows
                for
                interesting concepts in ship choices but also threatens the stability of the module metagame.
                Further details on each of these concepts will be explored below.
